Inspired by the gameplay of _Pokémon GO_ and the values of _ReFi (Regenerative Finance)_, Impact GO transforms everyday civic challenges into **impact quests**. By blending **fun, rewards, and transparency**, it motivates people to improve their neighborhoods while creating an open and verifiable **impact ledger** .

## 🚧 The Problem

Cities around the world face constant challenges in maintaining infrastructure and public spaces.

- Reporting systems are often **slow, bureaucratic, and opaque**.
- Citizens lack **incentives** to report issues.
- Data is siloed—governments, NGOs, and communities can’t **collaborate effectively**.

As a result, **small problems become big problems**, eroding community trust and quality of life.

## ✅ The Solution

Impact GO turns civic duty into a **game that pays back**:

1. **Snap & Tag** – Users take a photo of an issue and pin it to the map.
2. **Verify Together** – Other users confirm the issue for authenticity.
3. **Earn Rewards** – Validated reports mint an **NFT certificate** , while users earn **$IMPACT tokens**.
4. **Community Recognition** – Leaderboards, squads, and badges highlight contributions.
5. **Open Data** – All issues become part of a public, transparent impact ledger accessible to NGOs, local governments, and communities.
